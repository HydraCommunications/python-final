# Python Final Project
The final project repo for Mr. Plate's class.

# Prerequisites
- ### Install Tailwind Locally

>*not sure if this one is needed, but I've only
ever done this with npm based projects and idk if
github will take my pip installed files*

run: `python -m pip install Flask` in terminal

- ### Update Python

>*You'll probably need to do this because I updated the
project to the latest python.*

run `python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip` in terminal


# About the project

### Frontend layout

> *Components*
> 
> The html files we have are currently following what I have
> for other projects. Reused components like navbars and footers
> have been put in the templates/components/ folder so that we
> can avoid code duplication. If need be we can change this,
> but I think it is a relatively elegant solution.
> 
> *Styling*
> 
> I've installed tailwind to the project so that we can have
> a better experience with styling. Personally, I have grown rather
> tired of writing 700 Billion reused css classes, so tailwind
> is what I want to do. Again, if the group decides not to, 
> we can change this.
