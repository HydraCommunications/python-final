# Prerequisites

run `python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip` in terminal


# About the project

### Frontend layout

> *Components*
> 
> The html files we have are currently following what I have
> for other projects. Reused components like navbars and footers
> have been put in the templates/components/ folder so that we
> can avoid code duplication. If need be we can change this,
> but I think it is a relatively elegant solution.
> 
> *Styling*
> 
> I've installed tailwind to the project so that we can have
> a better experience with styling. Personally, I have grown rather
> tired of writing 700 Billion reused css classes, so tailwind
> is what I want to do. Again, if the group decides not to, 
> we can change this.
> 
> You'll need to run this while styling, just do it in the integrated terminal.
> `npx tailwindcss -i ./static/src/input.css -o ./static/dist/css/output.css --watch`
